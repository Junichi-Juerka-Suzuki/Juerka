## What is this?
This is the code intended to simulate spiking neural network activities.
I was impressed by Mr.Izhikevich's great simulation (https://www.izhikevich.org/publications/spikes.htm) and I try to create "yet another" spiking neural network simulation somehow optimized for x86_64 architecture.

## The purpose of this?
This project is intended to propose the basis for a large scale spiking neural network simulation.
Experiments, something interesting, will be performed in fork or derived projects.
And some utilities, what I currently imagine is the visualization tools, will also be prepared in another projects.

## Who contributes to this?
